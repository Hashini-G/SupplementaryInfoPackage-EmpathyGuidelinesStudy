This is the supplementary information package of the IEEE Software paper titled "Empathy Guidelines for Improving Practitioner Well-being &amp; Software Engineering Practices" authored by Hashini Gunatilake, John Grundy, Rashina Hoda, and Ingo Mueller.

The study employed a mixed-method approach, using Thematic analysis for qualitative data analysis. We employed a large-scale survey to explore the practical implementation of the empathy guidelines. Practitioners were asked to evaluate the importance of each guideline in real-world industry settings, assess the practicality and ease of implementation of guidelines, and indicate their willingness to adopt these guidelines in everyday SE practices. In addition, we gathered qualitative insights on how practitioners would apply these guidelines in practice, the limitations they perceived, challenges they anticipated in adoption, and suggestions for improving the guidelines to enhance their applicability. Drawing on insights from this study, this article examines how the proposed empathy guidelines can be effectively implemented in practice.
